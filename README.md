# MFA
Multi-Scale Fine-grained Alignments for Image and Sentence Matching
## Introduction
In this work, we propose a novel Multi-scale Fine-grained Alignments Network (MFA), which can effectively explore multi-scale visual-textual correspondences to facilitate bridging cross-modal discrepancy.  
We'll release the code soon.
